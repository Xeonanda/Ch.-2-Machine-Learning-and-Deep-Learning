## Program Overview

### 1. Churn Status Prediction in Banking [`Assignment2_No1.ipynb`]

This program involves building a classification model to predict customer churn in banking dataset by implementing and training three different models. Each model is already properly configured and evaluated using relevant performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 - score. After than, a detailed comparison is made to determine which model performs the best, along with an explanation of the reasons for its superior performance.

### 2. Choosing the optimal number of cluster from Random Data Points [`Assignment2_No2.ipynb`]

This program involves determining the optimal number of clusters for a set of random data points using K-Means Clustering algorithms. After that, there will be a detailed summary to identify the optimal number of clusters based on Silhouette Score. Finally, the clusters will be visualized to show how the data points are grouped into different clusters, providing a clear representation of clustering result.

### 3. Predicting House Prices using Multilayer Perceptron [`Assignment2_No3.ipynb`]

This program involves applying a neural network built with TensorFlow Keras to predict house prices using MLP. This program start with splitting the data into train, validation, and test, Standarization, Normalization, Training the model, Saving the model. Finally, predict using new data at the model and see the result.

### 4. Credit Card Fraud Detection Classification using Multilayer Perceptron [`Assignment2_No4.ipynb`]

This program involves on building Classification on Credit Card Fraud Detection using MLP and CUDA GPU for training. This program start with importing the dataset, remove the column ID, split the dataset to 80% and 20%, defining the hyperparameters, defining the input for models. Finally, fine tuning the model if the accuracy is still below 95%.
